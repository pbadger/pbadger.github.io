        Nadeem Mazen is a local business owner, educator, and innovator. After moving to Cambridge for undergraduate and graduate work at MIT, Nadeem fell in love with the city and opened two small businesses in Central Square. Both provide community access to cutting-edge technology, services, and job training.
         
        Nadeem also holds a faculty position at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, where he teaches entrepreneurship and small business practices to emerging artists.
         
        Nadeem's unique set of collaborative and creative problem-solving skills stem from his leadership background in business, art, and technology. He will use this experience to energize City Hall and make municipal politics more accessible.
